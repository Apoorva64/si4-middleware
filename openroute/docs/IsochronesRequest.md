# IO.Swagger.Model.IsochronesRequest
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Id** | **string** | Arbitrary identification string of the request reflected in the meta information. | [optional] 
**Locations** | **List&lt;List&lt;double?&gt;&gt;** | The locations to use for the route as an array of &#x60;longitude/latitude&#x60; pairs in WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) | 
**LocationType** | **string** | &#x60;start&#x60; treats the location(s) as starting point, &#x60;destination&#x60; as goal. | [optional] [default to LocationTypeEnum.Start]
**Range** | **List&lt;double?&gt;** | Maximum range value of the analysis in **seconds** for time and **metres** for distance.Alternatively a comma separated list of specific range values. Ranges will be the same for all locations. | 
**RangeType** | **string** | Specifies the isochrones reachability type. | [optional] [default to RangeTypeEnum.Time]
**Units** | **string** | Specifies the distance units only if &#x60;range_type&#x60; is set to distance. Default: m.  | [optional] [default to UnitsEnum.M]
**Options** | [**RouteOptions**](RouteOptions.md) |  | [optional] 
**AreaUnits** | **string** | Specifies the area unit. Default: m.  | [optional] [default to AreaUnitsEnum.M]
**Intersections** | **bool?** | Specifies whether to return intersecting polygons.  | [optional] [default to false]
**Attributes** | **List&lt;string&gt;** | List of isochrones attributes | [optional] 
**Interval** | **double?** | Interval of isochrones or equidistants. This is only used if a single range value is given. Value in **seconds** for time and **meters** for distance. | [optional] 
**Smoothing** | **double?** | Applies a level of generalisation to the isochrone polygons generated as a &#x60;smoothing_factor&#x60; between &#x60;0&#x60; and &#x60;100.0&#x60;. Generalisation is produced by determining a maximum length of a connecting line between two points found on the outside of a containing polygon. If the distance is larger than a threshold value, the line between the two points is removed and a smaller connecting line between other points is used. Note that the minimum length of this connecting line is ~1333m, and so when the &#x60;smoothing_factor&#x60; results in a distance smaller than this, the minimum value is used. The threshold value is determined as &#x60;(maximum_radius_of_isochrone / 100) * smoothing_factor&#x60;. Therefore, a value closer to 100 will result in a more generalised shape. The polygon generation algorithm is based on Duckham and al. (2008) &#x60;\&quot;Efficient generation of simple polygons for characterizing the shape of a set of points in the plane.\&quot;&#x60; | [optional]
